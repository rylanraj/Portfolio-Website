        <h2>PREVIOUS PROJECTS</h2>
        <h3>Bouncy Ball Game (Java Swing)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li class = "list-body">
                Project Description: Used the Timer class to simulate frames via an ActionListener to make a ball drawn
                onto the JPanel fall by increasing its y coordinates exponentially to simulate gravity. The player could
                tap the space bar resulting in the ball bouncing back up by temporarily making gravity negative. Pairs
                of obstacles moving horizontally at varying heights can be passed resulting in a point for the player.
                If the player has the ball collide with an obstacle, it results in a game over.

        <h3>Super Mario Bros Remake (Java Greenfoot)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li class = "list-body">
                Project Description:
                Remade all essential game logic of Super Mario Bros inside of the Java simulation framework Greenfoot.
                Contains animations, movement logics (jumping, sliding, slide-duck, sprinting, collision), power up
                blocks, world selection which unlocks upon completion of the previous level, enemy animations and
                movement logic, enemy stomping functionality, and various world-scrolling algorithms.

        <h3>Tower Defense Game (Java Greenfoot)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li class = "list-body">
                Project Description:
                Contains shop system, enemy waves, entities snapping to a tile-system,
                custom entity placement on a 2D plane, game over on enemy breakthrough

        <h3>Encryption-Decryption Algorithms (Java FileIO)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li class = "list-body">
                Project Description: Created file encryption-decryption algorithms using ascii keys,
                and unique file writing and reading methods to compliment these algorithms.
            </li>

        <h3>3D Basketball Simulator (C# Unity)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li class = "list-body">
                Project Description: Imported self-made basketball assets from blender
                into Unity. Created a script for player movement which allowed first-person
                movement in the created environment. Created another script which allowed
                the player object to pick up a basketball object and shoot the ball from a
                first-person perspective at an adjustable force. Created audio effects in FL
                Studio.

        <h3>Full Stack Blog Application (Python Django)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li class = "list-body">
                Project Description: Stored user information in the built-in
                databases of Django, created forms for user registration, login, and blog posting through
                implementation of HTTP methods. Used built in templating to connect the backend to the
                front end and for overall organization. Also included bootstrap to add visual appeal
                to the HTML and CSS.
