    <p class="index-information"><b>About Me</b></p>
    <p class="index-information"> When I was younger I was always interested in Computers. I enjoyed playing video games
    for the longest time. However, upon growing older I realized I liked creating things on the computer more.
    I know it seems strange because the stereotype about programmers is that they all like to play video games, but
    for me, it seems like that the more skills I got in creating computer programs, the less interested I became in games
        and the more interested I became in creating programs that aren't just games, but tests of what I know and
        what I can do with that knowledge.
