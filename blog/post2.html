    <h1>HOW I LEARNED TO CODE IN JAVA WITH NO EXPERIENCE</h1>
    <p class="blog-body">
        I first began to learn Java in grade 11. My Computer Programming teacher Scott Rowell decided he would teach us
        the fundamentals of Java inside of Greenfoot. At first, I honestly had no idea what practicality of learning how
        to code in pre-made software had since I thought programming was making the software yourself. But, after
        completing the course I realized the practicality coding in Greenfoot provided. You could grasp OOP principles
        more easily since the objects YOU created were manifested in the world YOU also created. 3 years later I'm
        still glad that it all started in Greenfoot as without those initial OOP concepts I wouldn't be able to create
        more complex software today.

    <p class="blog-body">
        Java is also a language where must absolutely understand the fundamentals or else you'll be leaving yourself
        more confused once you advance to more difficult topics. In Computer Programming 12 we continued from where
        we left off in grade 11 to learn some of these more difficult topics. Since we understood the basics so well,
        my teacher decided that we would extend beyond the curriculum and basically let us create whatever we wanted
        for our final projects through self-study. This was good for us as students because this field of work is all
        about self-study and learning how to use new technologies.

    </p>
    <p class="blog-body">
        Overall, the process of learning Java with no previous experience mostly relied on the will to self-study, and
        not being afraid to ask someone who was experienced for help whenever I was stuck on something or didn't
        understand a concept simply through my own interpretations.
