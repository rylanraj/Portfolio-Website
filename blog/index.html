    <h2>PREVIOUS PROJECTS</h2>
    <h3>Bouncy Ball Game (Java Swing)</h3>
    <ul>
        <li class = "list-body">
            Project Description: Used the Timer class to simulate frames via an ActionListener to make a ball drawn
            onto the JPanel fall by increasing its y coordinates exponentially to simulate gravity.
            The player could
            tap the space bar resulting in the ball bouncing back up by temporarily making gravity negative.
            Pairs
            of obstacles moving horizontally at varying heights can be passed
            resulting in a point for the player.
            If the player has the ball collide with an obstacle, it results in a game over.

    <h3>3D Basketball Simulator (C# Unity)</h3>
    <ul>
        <li class = "list-body">
            Project Description: Imported self-made basketball assets from blender
            into Unity.
            Created a script for player movement which allowed first-person
            movement in the created environment.
            Created another script which allowed
            the player object to pick up a basketball object and shoot the ball from a
            first-person perspective at an adjustable force.
            Created audio effects in FL
            Studio.

            databases of Django, created forms for user registration, login, and blog posting through
            implementation of HTTP methods.
            Used built in templating to connect the backend to the
            front end and for overall organization.
            It also included bootstrap to add visual appeal
            to the HTML and CSS.
